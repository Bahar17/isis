The `UrlEncodingService` (`1.11.0-SNAPSHOT`) is used by the framework to map view model mementos (derived from the state
of the view model itself) into a form that can be used as a view model.  When the framework needs to recreate the
view model (for example to invoke an action on it), this URL is converted back into a view model memento, from which
the view model can then be hydrated.

The framework provides a default implementation of this service, `UrlEncodingServiceUsingBaseEncoding` (also in the
applib) that uses `base-64` encoding to `UTF-8` charset.


== SPI

The SPI defined by the service is:

[source,java]
----
public interface UrlEncodingService {
    @Programmatic
    public String encode(final String str);     // <1>
    @Programmatic
    public String decode(String str);           // <2>
}
----
<1> convert the string (eg view model memento) into a string safe for use within an URL
<2> unconvert the string from its URL form into its original form URL
